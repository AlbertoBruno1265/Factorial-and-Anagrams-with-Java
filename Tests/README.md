# Permutation and Anagrams with Java
## Permutation and anagrams for OOP training
This is a small project that unites concepts of combinatorial analysis and object-oriented programming.

It's the same thing that i made [here](https://github.com/AlbertoBruno1265/Permutation-and-Anagrams-Classes), but now, i'm using Java.

I'm doing this to train and improve my OOP skills.
## ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- [ ] Create Permutation Class
   - [ ] Create simple permutation method
   - [ ] Create permutation with repetition method
   - [ ] Crete circular permutation method
- [ ] Create Anagrams Class
   - [ ] Create count of permutation method
   - [ ] Create random anagrams genaration method

**Optional:**
- [ ] Create a Game Class
   - [ ] Random anagrams genaration
   - [ ] Player methods
